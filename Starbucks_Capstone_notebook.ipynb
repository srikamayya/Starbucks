    "# Starbucks Capstone Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to combine transaction, demographic and offer data to determine which demographic groups respond best to which offer type. This data set is a simplified version of the real Starbucks app because the underlying simulator only has one product whereas Starbucks actually sells dozens of products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every offer has a validity period before the offer expires. As an example, a BOGO offer might be valid for only 5 days. You'll see in the data set that informational offers have a validity period even though these ads are merely providing information about a product; for example, if an informational offer has 7 days of validity, you can assume the customer is feeling the influence of the offer for 7 days after receiving the advertisement.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be given transactional data showing user purchases made on the app including the timestamp of purchase and the amount of money spent on a purchase. This transactional data also has a record for each offer that a user receives as well as a record for when a user actually views the offer. There are also records for when a user completes an offer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind as well that someone using the app might make a purchase through the app without having received an offer or seen an offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "To give an example, a user could receive a discount offer buy 10 dollars get 2 off on Monday. The offer is valid for 10 days from receipt. If the customer accumulates at least 10 dollars in purchases during the validity period, the customer completes the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are a few things to watch out for in this data set. Customers do not opt into the offers that they receive; in other words, a user can receive an offer, never actually view the offer, and still complete the offer. For example, a user might receive the \"buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer\", but the user never opens the offer during the 10 day validity period. The customer spends 15 dollars during those ten days. There will be an offer completion record in the data set; however, the customer was not influenced by the offer because the customer never viewed the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes data cleaning especially important and tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also want to take into account that some demographic groups will make purchases even if they don't receive an offer. From a business perspective, if a customer is going to make a 10 dollar purchase without an offer anyway, you wouldn't want to send a buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer. You'll want to try to assess what a certain demographic group will buy when not receiving any offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Advice\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is a capstone project, you are free to analyze the data any way you see fit. For example, you could build a machine learning model that predicts how much someone will spend based on demographics and offer type. Or you could build a model that predicts whether or not someone will respond to an offer. Or, you don't need to build a machine learning model at all. You could develop a set of heuristics that determine what offer you should send to each customer (i.e., 75 percent of women customers who were 35 years old responded to offer A vs 40 percent from the same demographic to offer B, so send offer A)."

    "# Data Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is contained in three files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)\n",
    "* profile.json - demographic data for each customer\n",
    "* transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the schema and explanation of each variable in the files:\n",
    "\n",
    "**portfolio.json**\n",
    "* id (string) - offer id\n",
    "* offer_type (string) - type of offer ie BOGO, discount, informational\n",
    "* difficulty (int) - minimum required spend to complete an offer\n",
    "* reward (int) - reward given for completing an offer\n",
    "* duration (int) - time for offer to be open, in days\n",
    "* channels (list of strings)\n",
    "\n",
    "**profile.json**\n",
    "* age (int) - age of the customer \n",
    "* became_member_on (int) - date when customer created an app account\n",
    "* gender (str) - gender of the customer (note some entries contain 'O' for other rather than M or F)\n",
    "* id (str) - customer id\n",
    "* income (float) - customer's income\n",
    "\n",
    "**transcript.json**\n",
    "* event (str) - record description (ie transaction, offer received, offer viewed, etc.)\n",
    "* person (str) - customer id\n",
    "* time (int) - time in hours since start of test. The data begins at time t=0\n",
    "* value - (dict of strings) - either an offer id or transaction amount depending on the record\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you are using the workspace, you will need to go to the terminal and run the command `conda update pandas` before reading in the files. This is because the version of pandas in the workspace cannot read in the transcript.json file correctly, but the newest version of pandas can. You can access the termnal from the orange icon in the top left of this notebook.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can see how to access the terminal and how the install works using the two images below.  First you need to access the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pic1.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you will want to run the above command:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pic2.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, when you enter back into the notebook (use the jupyter icon again), you should be able to run the below cell without any errors."

In other words, customers at age 118 has no registered ‘gender’ and ‘income’. This needs to be cleaned in the Data Preprocessing (Wrangling/Cleaning) Section.\n",

Keeping in our mind the above observation that there are 2175 missing values, Male Customers (8484 men) are more than Female Customers(6129 women) with 57% of customers are Males compared to 41% Females. However, there are 212 customers chose “O” as their gender.\n"

As presented on the table, we had 100% accuracy in both training and testing sets for 4 models ( out of 6). To avoid over fitting as much as possible, I will choose the model that gave me the lowest accuracy score on the testing set,which is the KNeighborsClassifier. On this model , I got 99.88% on testing set. I know that this is a very high score, but I the other scores are higher than that. I chose this model because I believe that is can be used on a to solve a Binary outcome problem statement. On whther the customer will view the offer ( just viewing) or he (complete the offer).\n",

    "#### Through this project , I tried to analyze the datasets provided by Starbucks and then build a model that can predict whether a customer would complete the offer or just view it?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I have explored each dataset, visualize it to get an overall understanding on the data. This also included analyzing different aspects of the datasets. Then, I moved to the Preprocessing Part. Preprocessing Data was the task that took most of the time and effort. The dataset is a bit tricky and the data included required me to use my wrangling/ engineering and preprocessing skills to get the final clean version of the three datasets. The next step was to create some latent features that can improve the performance of the model. These featured were actually derived from orginal existing column but with less range of values and simple values to include within the data set. Examples on that are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'age_group' feature derived from 'age' feature. I was ,then, replace the feature's categorical labels by a corresponding numerical label, as follows: \n",
    "    - 1 : teenager\n",
    "    - 2 : young-adult\n",
    "    - 3 : adult\n",
    "    - 4 : elderly\n",
    "\n",
    "-  'income_range' feature derived from 'income' feature. that includes the income-range to which the customer's income belongs. Then, I replaced the 'income_range' categorical labels by corresponding numerical labels, as follows: \n",
    "    - 1 : average (30,000 - 60,000)\n",
    "    - 2 : above-average (60,0001 - 90,000)\n",
    "    - 3 : high (more than 90,000)\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'member_type' feature derived from 'became_member_on' feature.  Of course, the features categorical labels has been replaced by corresponding numerical labels, as follows: \n",
    "    - 1 : new (memebr since 1000 days or less)\n",
    "    - 2 : regular (1001 - 1,600 days of membership)\n",
    "    - 3 : loyal (more than 1,600 days of membership)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The quick analysis on the datasets allowed me to get the following insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Customers income ranges from 30,000 and 120,000 with most of the customers’ incomes fall between 50,000 and 75,0000.\n",
    "* According to the available data, There are three ‘gender’ categories into which the customers falls in ( M, F and O). Keeping in our mind the above observation that there are 2175 missing values, Male Customers (8484 men) are more than Female Customers(6129 women) with 57% of customers are Males compared to 41% Females. However, there are 212 customers chose “O” as their gender.\n",
    "* The most common offer type among all age groups is the BOGO , followed by the Discount Offers. Whereas, the least common offer to be sent is the informational offers. I believe that BOGO offers are more attractive compared to other offers provided by Starbucks.\n",
    "* Customers with High income (Above 90,000) are mostly female customers. Whereas, Average Income(30,000 - 60,000) customers are mostly males.\n",
    "* Males and Females are pretty close when it comes to the time spent to complete an offer. Both males and females take about 17 days to da so.\n",
    "* 2017 was the best year for Starbucks in terms of the number of new members. Around %38 of all the customers on our dataset regiseterd as members on this specific year.\n",
    "* Both genders like BOGO and Discount offers and they have the same reaction toward Informational offers, they both seem to be not interested to it.\n",
    "* The mean time it takes a customer to complete an offer is less than 16 days (372 hours).\n",
    "* Females completed around 75% of the offers they viewed, it is 16% more than males who just completed 58% of the offers they viewed. Feamles seems to be convinced by the promotion easier than males.\n"
